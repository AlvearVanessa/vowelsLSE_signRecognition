# vowelsLSE Sign Recognition

In this work, we presented a sign recognition system based on hand detection and image classification of the vowels of the Spanish Sign language (Lengua de Signos Espa√±ola - LSE), to make the recognition of the vowels of the LSE in real-time. The vowelsLSE dataset consists of 5 gestures of one person signing each vowel according to LSE, and contains 3461 images. It consists of RGB images in JPG format with a size of 400 x 400 and has a white background to make them the same size. This dataset has been created as a proof of concept and is being worked on for improvement in future updates. This work was based on the Hand Sign Detection (ASL) course on the following website: https://www.computervision.zone/courses/hand-sign-detection-asl/


The repository includes:

        inference_images folder contains images for making inferences once the classification models were trained.
        
        integration_codes folder includes six Python scripts where the detection and classification models get in merged to make the recognition of the vowels of the LSE:
        
          - DataCollection.py to collect and create the vowelsLSE dataset.          
          - HandTrackingModule_noSkeleton.py is the hand detection module and works for Keras and FastAI library.          
          - classificationModule_init.py is the classification module for the vowels of LSE works for Keras model.      
          - classificationModule_init_fastai.py is the classification module for the vowels of LSE works for FastAI model.      
          - signRecognition_init.py is a recognition module for the vowels of LSE in real-time using the hand detection and image classification modules works for Keras model. 
          - signRecognition_init_fastai.py is a recognition module for the vowels of LSE in real-time using the hand detection and image classification modules works for FastAI model.
          
          
        models folder has two image classification models:    
        
          - NN2_keras.ipynb. It is a complex neural network created with Keras and Tensorflow libraries using Keras Tuner for hyperparameter search.          
          - ResNet50_fastai.ipynb. It is a model which apply ResNet50 architecture and used the FastAI library. 
          
        notebook_images folder contains two images, one indicates the transformations applied for data, and the other is the signs of the vowels of the LSE.
